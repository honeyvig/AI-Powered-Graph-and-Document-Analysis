# AI-Powered-Graph-and-Document-Analysis
an enthusiastic bright junior AI developer / intern who wants to learn advanced ai while helping me on exciting usecase.  help prototype an innovative idea using Python and OpenAI models. The project involves creating an AI solution that can analyze documents and generate use neo4j graphs. Need to be bright pythoner having basic experience calling openai models (no ml experience needed) will be pivotal in bringing this concept to life.

You will get guidance to solve complex ai usecase and get to learn from an expert while making money for it. I need you to dedicate 3-4 hrs daily be focussed and excited about solving problem and learning advanced ai( no experience needed)

1. Python coding
2. Calling OpenAI models using python
3.  Neo4j exp(nice to have)
4. Building  ux( Django/ flask/ react) - nice to have

   ==================
To help you build an innovative AI solution that can analyze documents and generate Neo4j graphs, we will break the problem into manageable steps. The primary tasks include using Python to call OpenAI models for document analysis, and using Neo4j for graph generation. For this project, you don't need any machine learning experience, but some basic Python knowledge and the ability to call OpenAI models will be crucial.

Here’s a step-by-step guide, including code examples, to help you prototype this solution.
Prerequisites:

    Python 3.8+ installed on your machine.
    Neo4j Database: Install Neo4j locally or use a cloud instance (Neo4j Aura).
    OpenAI API Key: You’ll need an OpenAI API key to call GPT models.
    Libraries: Install necessary libraries with the following commands:

    pip install openai
    pip install py2neo
    pip install flask  # If you're building the app with Flask (Optional)

Steps to Implement:

    Setup OpenAI API Integration: We will use OpenAI’s GPT models to analyze the documents and extract useful information.

    Document Analysis: The AI will process a document (e.g., text, PDF) and identify entities, relationships, and relevant data points.

    Neo4j Graph Generation: Using the processed data, we will generate a graph in Neo4j, where each entity is a node, and the relationships between them are represented as edges.

    Building a Simple Web Interface: Optionally, we will create a basic Flask or Django app for users to upload documents and view the generated graph.

Code Example
1. Setup OpenAI Integration

Here’s how to call the OpenAI model to analyze documents:

import openai

# Set OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key-here'

# Function to analyze document using GPT-3
def analyze_document(document_text):
    prompt = f"Analyze this document and extract entities and their relationships: {document_text}"
    
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # You can use other models like GPT-4 if you have access
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=500,  # Adjust the token limit based on your document's length
        temperature=0.5,
        n=1,
        stop=None
    )
    
    # Return the analysis (entities and relationships)
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example document text (You can load this from files, PDF, etc.)
document = """
John is a software engineer at TechCorp. He worked with Sarah on the AI project last year. Sarah is a data scientist at TechCorp.
They both attended the AI conference in 2022, where they met David, the CTO of InnovateAI.
"""

analysis_result = analyze_document(document)
print(analysis_result)

In this function:

    The OpenAI model processes the text, analyzes it, and returns extracted entities and relationships. You can enhance the prompt for more specific outputs, like "entities", "relationships", or "concepts".

2. Neo4j Graph Generation

Once we extract entities and relationships from the document, we will use Neo4j to create a graph.

from py2neo import Graph, Node, Relationship

# Connect to your Neo4j instance (local or cloud)
graph = Graph("bolt://localhost:7687", auth=("neo4j", "password"))

def create_graph_from_analysis(analysis_result):
    # Example: The analysis result is a list of relationships in this format:
    # John (person) - works at - TechCorp (company)
    # John (person) - worked with - Sarah (person)
    # Sarah (person) - is a - data scientist (job title)
    
    # Split the result into entities and relationships (this is a simplified parsing)
    relationships = [
        ("John", "works at", "TechCorp"),
        ("John", "worked with", "Sarah"),
        ("Sarah", "is a", "data scientist"),
        ("John", "attended", "AI conference 2022"),
        ("Sarah", "attended", "AI conference 2022"),
        ("David", "is a", "CTO"),
        ("David", "works at", "InnovateAI"),
    ]
    
    # Create nodes and relationships in Neo4j
    for start, rel_type, end in relationships:
        start_node = Node("Person", name=start)
        end_node = Node("Organization" if "Corp" in end else "Person", name=end)
        relationship = Relationship(start_node, rel_type, end_node)
        
        graph.merge(start_node, "Person", "name")  # Ensure unique person nodes
        graph.merge(end_node, "Organization" if "Corp" in end else "Person", "name")
        graph.create(relationship)

# Create a graph based on the analysis result
create_graph_from_analysis(analysis_result)

In this function:

    We process the entities and relationships extracted by the OpenAI model and create nodes and relationships in Neo4j.
    graph.merge() ensures that we don't create duplicate nodes for the same entities.

3. Web Interface with Flask (Optional)

You can build a basic web interface to interact with the system using Flask. This allows users to upload documents and visualize the generated graph.

from flask import Flask, request, render_template
from py2neo import Graph

app = Flask(__name__)

# Initialize Neo4j connection
graph = Graph("bolt://localhost:7687", auth=("neo4j", "password"))

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_document():
    file = request.files['document']
    document_text = file.read().decode('utf-8')  # Assume the document is a plain text file

    # Step 1: Analyze the document with OpenAI
    analysis_result = analyze_document(document_text)
    
    # Step 2: Create a graph from the analysis result
    create_graph_from_analysis(analysis_result)
    
    return f"Graph created successfully based on document analysis."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

In this Flask app:

    Users can upload documents via a simple form.
    The uploaded document is passed to the analyze_document function to extract entities and relationships.
    After analysis, a Neo4j graph is created based on the extracted data.

Next Steps for You (As a Junior Developer):

    Learn and Experiment: Start by experimenting with small document samples and see how OpenAI’s API works for extracting entities and relationships.

    Neo4j Basics: Learn the basics of Neo4j and graph theory. This will help you understand how to structure and visualize data efficiently.

    Flask (Optional): If you’re interested in building a user interface, try Flask (or Django) to create a web-based tool where users can upload documents and view the graph.

    Iterate: As you work on this, you’ll refine your understanding of AI integration, document processing, and graph creation.

Conclusion:

This project will give you a chance to learn the ins and outs of integrating OpenAI models for document analysis, and how to generate meaningful data structures (graphs) using Neo4j. This combination of AI and database technologies will provide you with a solid foundation for building future applications and improving your skills as a developer.
